Tiny Conflict 2D is a clone from the GameBoy Advance 2001 turn-based game "Advance Wars". I used it to learn the Godot engine.

How to play :

- Use the arrow keys to move the cursor, and space to select.
- Unit can be moved once per turn.
- Infantry can capture buildings.
- You can select factories / ports / airports to buy units with player resources.
- Resources are provided by cities.

To win the game, capture the opposing HQ

PS : This repo focus on game mechanics and bases with Godot development. Sprites and tiles animations will be implemented in the V2 Project.
