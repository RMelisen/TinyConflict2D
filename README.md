Tiny Conflict 2D is a clone from the GameBoy Advance 2001 turn-based game "Advance Wars". I used it to learn the Godot engine.

How to play :

- Use the arrow keys to move the cursor, and space to select.
- Unit can be moved once per turn.
- Infantry can capture buildings.
- You can select factories / ports / airports to buy units with player resources.
- Resources are provided by cities.

To win the game, capture the opposing HQ.

Roadmap :

- [X] Terrain management
- [X] Scenes/sprites implementation
- [X] Unit creation
- [X] Unit movement and pathfinding
- [ ] Turn management
- [ ] Unit combat
- [ ] Money management
- [ ] Unit transportation
- [ ] Local multiplayer
- [ ] Online multiplayer 
- [ ] V2 - Better resources, animations, vision management, more maps, etc...

PS : This repo focus on game mechanics and bases with Godot development. Sprites and tiles animations will be implemented in the V2 Project.
